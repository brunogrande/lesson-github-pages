# Leading a Study Group Session

We want your workshops to be the best they can be. We believe in a dynamic teaching style 
that engages the audience. To achieve this, here are a few guidelines for leading a study 
group session. 

## Checklist (tl;dr)

## The Longer Version

### 1. Design the lesson for a one-hour time slot

It's hard to time a hands-on lesson because it depends on your audience and their 
preferred pace. Your best bet is to plan to cover the basics within an hour at a slow 
pace, but have some extra optional material at the end if things go faster than expected. 
Importantly, if you do not get through everything, it's okay. It's better that you leave 
stuff out than rush through the material. Your notes will (hopefully) be published, so
people can learn in their own time afterwards. 

### 2. Ensure the topic is of general interest

This study group is for scientific programmers. Hence, the audience members will come from 
diverse backgrounds. Your lesson should take this into account and not be too domain-
specific. Of course, you can use your own data for demonstration purposes, but try to keep 
the problems you are trying to solve with your programming tool to those of general 
interest. 

### 3. Start of with the motivation for what you are teaching

What problem can the tool you are teaching solve? Why is that tool ideal for solving that 
problem? Spending 2-5 minutes on the motivation for learning the tool and setting up the 
problem is essential to engage your learners.

### 4. No lecture slides, just live demos

It's much more engaging if you demonstrate the code you're presenting as opposed to just 
lecturing. It ensures that your audience can follow you as you go along. Also, please send 
the organizers the data files your audience will need to follow along with you ahead of 
the session you are leading.

### 5. Include some challenge questions

One easy way to test if your audience is understanding what you're demonstrating is to 
provide them with challenge questions. It allows you to make sure everyone is on the same 
page and help out those who are having trouble. And who doesn't enjoy the rush of dopamine 
when you get something to work?

### 6. Use the Sticky Note Methodâ„¢

We're not gonna lie about this: this idea is straight-up taken from Software Carpentry's 
book, because it works! The organizers will be providing each audience member with two 
differently coloured sticky notes. One will signify "I'm good!", while the other will 
signal "Help!" During challenge questions, this will allow those who raised the "I'm good" 
flag to help each other out. Collaboration is key!

### 7. Share the love! (And the notes)

As we've said, we're all about collaboration. This includes sharing your lesson notes. 
Not only does this permit study group members to refer back to the lesson, but it also 
allows others (here or elsewhere) to give the lesson themselves. 

## How to Screencast a Study Group Session

### Setup (for organizers)

1. Log in to Google with the study group account. 
2. Visit the Hangouts On Air page for the study group Google+ page. 
  1. Visit the study group's Google+ page.
  2. In the drop-down menu at the top-left of the page, click on Hangouts.
  3. At the top, click on the Hangouts on Air tab in the centre. 
5. Click the "Create a Hangout On Air" button. 
6. Name the Hangout using the following format: YYYY-MM-DD Topic Name, by Presenter Name
  * An example would be: 2015-07-21 Introduction to Regular Expressions, by Bruno Grande
7. If the presentation is imminent, select "Starts Now". Otherwise, select "Later" and indicate the date and time. 
8. When the time comes, follow the broadcast instructions below. 

### Broadcast (for presenters)

1. Ensure that you meet the [minimum requirements](https://support.google.com/hangouts/answer/1216376) for Google Hangouts. 
2. If so, install the [Google Hangouts plugin](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/hangoutplugin) if you don't already have it. 
3. Log in to Google with the study group account. Ask an organizer for this.
4. Visit the event page for the Hangout on Air. 
  1. Visit the study group's Google+ page.
  2. In the drop-down menu at the top-left of the page, click on Events.
  3. Click on the relevant Hangouts On Air event. 
5. Click on the Start button. 
6. Skip the "Invite guests" step. 
7. Switch the video to your screen by enabling the Screenshare app (look for green icon on the left-hand side).
  * If you will be switching between windows during the lesson, it would be best that you screenshare the entire screen.
8. Wait until the loading is ready (at the bottom) and then click "Start Broadcast".
