# Leading a Study Group Session

We want your workshops to be the best they can be. We believe in a dynamic teaching style 
that engages the audience. To achieve this, here are a few guidelines for leading a study 
group session. We use the term "tool" below, but this can as well be a programming language
as it can be a software package. 

## Checklist (tl;dr)

* [ ] Design lesson to last approximately one hour
* [ ] Explain the motivation for using this tool
* [ ] Code along as opposed to code lecturing
* [ ] Try not to be too domain-specific
* [ ] Include a few challenge problems (2-3)
* [ ] Keep toolbox as simple as possible
* [ ] Publish the lesson notes online for others to use
* [ ] Publish screencast online

## Checklist (--verbose)

### 1. Design lesson to last approximately one hour

While it's hard to time a hands-on lesson, try to design it such that it lasts 
approximately one hour. Importantly, if you don't get through everything, it's
okay. It's better to leave stuff out and allow the audience to look up your
lesson notes afterwards, if need be. If you speed through the end, you'll lose
your audience and they won't appreciate as much the value of the tool you're 
presenting. 

### 2. Explain the motivation for using this tool

Which problems does your tool solve? What differentiates the tool you're demonstrating
from alternatives? What is it good at? What is it not so good at? Spending some time
on the motivation for learning about this new tool and setting up the problem is
essential for engaging your audience. It provides them with a context for an otherwise
unfamiliar "thing". 

### 3. Code along as opposed to code lecturing

Demonstrating a tool as a code along is much more enjoyable than reading code off of 
slides. It ensures that every one feels like they're on the same boat. And when they
attain some milestone during the session, they get to feel that sense of achievement
that is absent from code lectures. So, be sure to circulate any lesson notes and
especially data that will be used in the lesson beforehand. 

### 4. Try not to be too domain-specific

We welcome scientific programmers from all fields. Accordingly, your lesson shouldn't
be too domain-specific. It's okay to use your own data as part of the demonstration, 
but be sure to highlight the value of the tool for other contexts as well. 

### 5. Include a few challenge problems (2-3)

While it might be easy to code along mindlessly by copying the presenter, challenge
problems allow the audience to take some time to synthesize what they've just learned
and apply it in some useful way. Furthermore, it gives a chance for yourself and helpers
to swoop in and help out anyone who got stuck at a certain point. Finally, why would we
take away the opportunity for the audience to experience that rush of dopamine when 
you get something to work? 

### 6. Keep toolbox as simple as possible

It might be tempting to show off more than one tool during the demonstration. In fact,
it's probably more representative of what happens in practice. However, with every new
tool that's introduced in a lesson, there's a significant burden in terms of cognitive
load put upon the audience. This distracts from the tool that's being demonstrated. 
Hence, we recommend that you restrict your toolbox to the strict necessary to do your
tool justice. 

### 7. Publish the lesson notes online for others to use

If you're reading off this template, you're already off to a good start. Ideally, you
can fork this repository and add your notes and data. By having your lesson hosted online
(_e.g._ like GitHub), it allows two things to happen: the audience have a resource they 
can revisit later when they wish to use the tool you demonstrated, and others can use and 
build off of your work when leading their own session. We're firm believers in collaboration!

### 8. Publish screencast online

Due to scheduling, some people won't be able to make it to your session, despite wanting to.
In some cases, they physically can't make it, and a live screencast would benefit them. In
other cases, they're busy, but would like to watch the lesson when they get the time. Posting
the screencast somewhere online enables this. We've included instructions below on how to set
up Google Hangouts On Air, which makes live screencasting rather painless. 

## How to Screencast a Study Group Session

### Setup (for organizers)

1. Log in to Google with the study group account. 
2. Visit the Hangouts On Air page for the study group Google+ page. 
  1. Visit the study group's Google+ page.
  2. In the drop-down menu at the top-left of the page, click on Hangouts.
  3. At the top, click on the Hangouts on Air tab in the centre. 
5. Click the "Create a Hangout On Air" button. 
6. Name the Hangout using the following format: YYYY-MM-DD Topic Name, by Presenter Name
  * An example would be: 2015-07-21 Introduction to Regular Expressions, by Bruno Grande
7. If the presentation is imminent, select "Starts Now". Otherwise, select "Later" and indicate the date and time. 
8. When the time comes, follow the broadcast instructions below. 

### Broadcast (for presenters)

1. Ensure that you meet the [minimum requirements](https://support.google.com/hangouts/answer/1216376) for Google Hangouts. 
2. If so, install the [Google Hangouts plugin](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/hangoutplugin) if you don't already have it. 
3. Log in to Google with the study group account. Ask an organizer for this.
4. Visit the event page for the Hangout on Air. 
  1. Visit the study group's Google+ page.
  2. In the drop-down menu at the top-left of the page, click on Events.
  3. Click on the relevant Hangouts On Air event. 
5. Click on the Start button. 
6. Skip the "Invite guests" step. 
7. Switch the video to your screen by enabling the Screenshare app (look for green icon on the left-hand side).
  * If you will be switching between windows during the lesson, it would be best that you screenshare the entire screen.
8. Wait until the loading is ready (at the bottom) and then click "Start Broadcast".
